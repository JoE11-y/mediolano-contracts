## 🏗️ Architecture Overview

### Core Components
```
User Achievements Contract
├── Achievement Tracking System
├── Activity Event Processing
├── Badge Management System
├── Certificate Management System
├── Leaderboard & Ranking System
├── Point System with Configurable Weights
└── Access Control & Owner Management
```

### Data Flow
```
User Activity → Activity Event → Achievement → Points → Leaderboard Update
     ↓
Badge/Certificate Minting → User Profile Update → Event Emission
```

## 🔧 Key Technical Solutions

### 1. Storage Optimization
```cairo
// Fixed storage mapping
activity_points: Map<u32, u32>, // Maps activity_type_id to points

// Helper function for conversion
fn _activity_type_to_id(self: @ContractState, activity_type: ActivityType) -> u32 {
    match activity_type {
        ActivityType::AssetMinted => 0,
        ActivityType::AssetSold => 1,
        // ... etc
    }
}
```

### 2. Access Control
```cairo
// Owner-only function example
fn record_achievement(...) {
    let caller = get_caller_address();
    assert!(caller == self.owner.read(), "Only owner can record achievements");
    // ... implementation
}
```

### 3. Test Structure
```cairo
// Proper test setup with owner handling
fn deploy_contract_with_owner(owner: ContractAddress) -> ContractAddress {
    let contract = declare("UserAchievements").unwrap().contract_class();
    let mut calldata = ArrayTrait::new();
    calldata.append(owner.into());
    let (contract_address, _) = contract.deploy(@calldata).unwrap();
    contract_address
}
```
